🧑‍💻 About Me

Hey, how’s it going? I’m a computer science student with a passion for solving problems and turning ideas into real, working projects. I enjoy digging into data, building full-stack applications, and learning how things work under the hood. Ask me about my most recent project—I’m always excited to talk about what I’m building and what I’m learning next.
