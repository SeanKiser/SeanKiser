🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate problem solver who enjoys turning ideas into real, working software. I love digging into tough challenges, learning new technologies, and building projects that people actually use. Currently my team and I are developing an online marketplace for students at UNC Charlotte, used for secure exchanges of goods and services. I’m always excited to talk about what I’m building and what I’m learning next.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I’m an active member of the Ultimate Frisbee team at UNC Charlotte, where I also serve as President. I led the organization of the annual Banc Run tournament and managed team finances. I also love bowling, when I'm not working or studying, I'm at the bowling alley.
